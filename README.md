USA Accidents Data Visualization
This project aims to visualize the USA accidents data obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents). The dataset contains information about accidents that occurred in the USA between 2016-2021, including their severity, location, weather conditions, and other factors.

## The project consists of three main components:

### Data exploration and preprocessing: 
In this step, we explore the dataset and preprocess it to prepare it for visualization. 

### Data visualization: 
In this step, we use the processed data to create visualizations that allow us to explore the relationships between different variables and gain insights about the accidents. 

### Project report: 
Finally, we create a project report that summarizes the main findings and insights from the data visualization. The report is stored in the outputs/report.pdf file.
